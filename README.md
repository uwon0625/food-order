# food-order

This project started when I was reading the book "Pro MERN Stack: Full Stack Web App Development with Mongo, Express, React, and Node".

I tried a couple of backend API frameworks, and settled with Strapi for its integration with GraphQL.

Main tools:
  React.Js v16.13(with hooks)
  ReactStrap v8.6
  Express v4.17
  GraphQL v15
  Next v9.4
  Strapi v3.1
  Stripe v8
  
To do:
  Data persistense
  Tests
